# Learn

This repository is a collection of directories in which I have learned and enhanced through examples my 
Python, API interactions, Machine Learning, OOP, Pandas and more


## Usage
Some directories are run as a sub-module, others as stand-alone files.

 <ins>59 Ways to Write Better Python</ins>

Each file is executed as a stand-alone file

```python
python <file.py>

```

 <ins>APIData</ins>

``import.py`` is the __main__ equivalent. This file interacts with a cryptocurrency exchange API, retrieves data, paginates and parses it, then dumps to a .json file.

```python
python learn/APIData/import.py

```
 <ins>ML</ins>

Containing some examples from 'Hands on Machine-Learning with Sci-Kit and Tensor flow.

Unexecutable in IDE (code writtein Jupyter notebook)

 <ins>PythonCourse</ins>
 
 All files executable as stand-alone files with examples of Python functionalities from a Python Udemy course.
 

```python
python learn/PythonCourse/<file>.py

```
