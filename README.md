# Learn

This repository is a collection of directories in which I have learned and enhanced through examples my 
Python, API interactions, Machine Learning, OOP, Pandas, Data Structures, Algorithms and more...


## Usage
Some directories are run as a sub-module, others as stand-alone files.

For the sub-directories

```python
python -m <sub_directory>

```

For stand alone files

```python
python <file_name>

```
